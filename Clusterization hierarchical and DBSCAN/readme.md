The Human Activity Recognition dataset was collected from the records of 30 participants, whose daily activities were monitored and digitized using a smartphone with built-in sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope). In total, information was collected for 6 types of activity: WALKING, WALKINGUPSTAIRS, WALKINGDOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING.

Each pattern in the dataset is represented by a vector of dimension 561 with descriptive statistics in time and frequency domain (accelerometer acceleration on different axes, estimated body acceleration, gyroscope speed on different axes, etc.) and 'Activity' feature that specifies the activity.
